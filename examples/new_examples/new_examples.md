# New examples

Overview markdown file with app. 3 lines of description per file. The rest is in Jupyter notebook files.

Each Jupyter notebook shuld not be longer than what can be printed on two standard pages.

Gold mining example is the overarching story.

This is a theory light introduction - Focus is on understanding principles and enable users to start using the package.

Can GitHub Actions run the notebooks and check for errors? (Treebeard?)

## Main storyline

1. Gold exists, find it starting with an arbitrary point.
2. Latin Hypercube Sampling (this is done by default, do we have to mention it?)
3. "Good enough" found during initialisation
4. batch vs. single opt.ask()
5. Noise
6. Narrow wells
7. Explore vs. exploit (Gold Diggerson vs. Map Drawson)
8. Plots (more about ALL of the plots)
9. Uncertainty
10. When to stop?

## Categorical

1. Shovel vs. drill

## Multiobjective

1. New train line
2. Plots
3. Tradeoffs
4. Silver vs. gold?
5. Rocks in the ground making it hard to dig?

## Constraints

1. Cut off "corner"

## Deep analysis

1. Kernel
2. Sampling from model
3. Scoring of model against ground truth

## Explore vs. exploit

1. Build on Gold Diggerson vs. Map Drawson
2. Change explore/exploit during optimisation

## Building in prior knowledge

1. Length scale knowledge
2. Length scale prior
3. Noise level
4. Experimental budget
